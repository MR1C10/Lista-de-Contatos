# Contact List

This project in C# is a simple contact management application, allowing the user to add, view, edit, and delete contacts from a list. The goal is to provide a basic interface for interacting with contact data and demonstrate list manipulation concepts in C#.

This project was created to better understand the use of dictionaries and infinite loops in C#. 

## Features

- **Add Contact:** The user can enter a name and a phone number to add a new contact to the list.
- **View Contacts:** All added contacts will be displayed on the screen.
- **Edit Contact:** It's possible to edit the details of an existing contact.
- **Delete Contact:** The user can delete contacts from the list.

## Technologies Used

- C#
- .NET (Console Application)

## Code Structure

- **Contato.cs:** Defines the `Contact` class, which contains the properties for name and phone number.
- **ListaContatos.cs:** Manages the list of contacts, with methods to add, edit, delete, and view contacts.
- **Program.cs:** Contains the main logic of the application, responsible for user interaction.

## Key Concepts Learned

- **Dictionaries:** In this project, I used dictionaries to store contacts efficiently. This allowed for quick lookup, update, and deletion of contacts based on the name.
- **Infinite Loops:** I implemented an infinite loop to keep the program running, allowing the user to interact with the contact list until they choose to exit the program.
- **Data Manipulation:** I learned how to manipulate lists and dictionaries to store and modify user data, gaining a better understanding of data structures and memory management in C#.
- **Basic Error Handling:** I added basic error handling to manage invalid input from the user and ensure the application runs smoothly.
- **User Input Validation:** I practiced validating user input to ensure that valid data is entered (such as checking for empty fields or invalid formats).
